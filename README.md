# ExactumLocator
An app made for indoor localization. To be used in the Exactum building of the University of Helsinki Kumpula campus.
The project localizes the user by changing the recieved signal strengths from routers located in the building to distances. It then uses multilateration on the locations of those routers and distances to them to calculate the position. 
The code for the multilateration is gotten from the project https://github.com/prbdias/multilateration, the licence for the project is included in this project.
